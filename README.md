# Tensorflow Simple Neural Network
A simple exemple of the tensorflow in the neural network concepts.

## tensorflow-vectors.py
Show the tensorflow methods used to manipulate vectors.

## tensorflow-nodes-one.py
This code is a example of one node, with two inputs and one output, simulating the node used in the neural networks.

## tensorflow-nodes-three.py
Similar to the above file, but more complex. Because it uses 3 nodes, two nodes are inputs for the third node, and using weights for calculate your outputs.
